#Add a Conditional Breakpoint
Set a Breakpoint: Click in the left margin next to the line if (result == 10) to set a breakpoint.
Right-Click the Breakpoint: Right-click the red dot that appears.
Set Condition: Select “Conditions…” from the context menu.
Enter Condition: In the dialog that appears, enter result == 10. The breakpoint will only be hit when this condition is true.
<hr/>
#Add a Tracepoint
Set a Breakpoint: Click in the left margin next to the line Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {i}, Result: {result}"); to set a breakpoint.
Right-Click the Breakpoint: Right-click the red dot.
When Hit…: Select “When Hit…” from the context menu.
Specify Message: In the dialog that appears, enter Iteration: {i}, Result: {result} in the “Output window” text box. This message will be printed in the Output window each time the tracepoint is hit.

#Explanation
Conditional Breakpoint: The breakpoint on if (result == 10) will only be triggered when the result variable equals 10. This helps you focus on specific conditions without stopping at every iteration.
Tracepoint: The tracepoint on Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {i}, Result: {result}"); will print the iteration and result values to the Output window each time it is hit, allowing you to monitor the values without pausing the execution.
By following these steps, you can effectively use conditional breakpoints and tracepoints to debug and monitor your application. This example provides a more detailed scenario with a class and methods to illustrate their usage.
