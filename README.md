Set a Breakpoint: Click in the left margin next to the line if (result == 10) to set a breakpoint.<br/>
Right-Click the Breakpoint: Right-click the red dot that appears.<br/>
Set Condition: Select “Conditions…” from the context menu.<br/>
Enter Condition: In the dialog that appears, enter result == 10. The breakpoint will only be hit when this condition is true.<br/>

#Add a Tracepoint<br/>
Set a Breakpoint: Click in the left margin next to the line Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {i}, Result: {result}"); to set a breakpoint.<br/>
Right-Click the Breakpoint: Right-click the red dot.<br/>
When Hit…: Select “When Hit…” from the context menu.<br/>
Specify Message: In the dialog that appears, enter Iteration: {i}, Result: {result} in the “Output window” text box. This message will be printed in the Output window each time the tracepoint is hit.<br/>

#Explanation<br/>
Conditional Breakpoint: The breakpoint on if (result == 10) will only be triggered when the result variable equals 10. This helps you focus on specific conditions without stopping at every iteration.<br/>
Tracepoint: The tracepoint on Console.WriteLine($"Iteration: {i}, Result: {result}"); will print the iteration and result values to the Output window each time it is hit, allowing you to monitor the values without pausing the execution.<br/>
By following these steps, you can effectively use conditional breakpoints and tracepoints to debug and monitor your application. This example provides a more detailed scenario with a class and methods to illustrate their usage.<br/>
